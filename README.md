## Installing and updating packages
This config uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), so you'll
need to run `:PlugInstall` and possibly `:PlugUpdate` once you've linked in the
configs.

From there, you should occasionally run `:PlugUpdate` to keep your
plugins up-to-date.

You can also run `:PlugUpgrade` to upgrade vim-plug itself.
